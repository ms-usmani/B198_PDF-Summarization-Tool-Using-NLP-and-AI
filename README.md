# Problem Statement

**Business Problem**

The customer organization, a news aggregation platform, requires the processing and summarization of substantial volumes of textual data from PDF documents. The main challenge is that customers often need to rapidly understand the contents of these publications without having to read them cover to cover. This means that for users to quickly grasp the key concepts, an NLP and AI-driven application must automatically provide concise summaries. 

**Importance of the Problem**

In the current digital era, people have increasing access to more information, which makes it harder to search through and locate relevant content. This tendency, frequently referred to as "information overload," can cause major issues for both individuals and businesses. Users are inundated with copious amounts of textual content from multiple sources, including news stories, research papers, reports, and more. There is a huge cognitive load involved in making sense of all this information, which can lead to decision fatigue and lower productivity.

Organizations must be able to quickly and clearly communicate important information in order to maintain users' satisfaction and engagement. People's attention spans are getting shorter, therefore there's a good probability more competent competitors will take their position. Thus, an AI-driven summarization tool is not just a convenience but also a need to guarantee that consumers can effectively navigate this sea of information. The tool provides summaries that highlight the key points so users may rapidly grasp the major concepts of papers without having to read through unnecessary details. In addition to saving time, users can focus on higher-level tasks like strategic planning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

**Benefits of the Solution**

The proposed NLP-based AI application offers extremely advantageous abstractive and extractive summaries that may be tailored to meet a variety of user needs. This dual approach boosts the value of the platform by offering customers the choice between an original, concise summary (abstractive) or an extended, verbatim excerpt (extractive). Operational efficiencies are enhanced by automating the summarizing process, since it significantly decreases the amount of manual work needed for content processing. As a result, the customer's company can handle larger data quantities and save costs without compromising quality. Scalability allows the platform to remain competitive while accommodating increasing user needs, which in turn increases user satisfaction and retention.
